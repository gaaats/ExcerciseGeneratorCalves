    <string name="text_activity_good">The calf is located on the posterior (back) of the lower leg. It consists of two muscles: the gastrocnemius and the soleus.

The gastrocnemius is the bulkier portion of the calf and the larger of the two muscles. It has two origins that attach to the femur. The medial head originates on the medial condyle of the femur and lateral head originates on the lateral condyle of the femur. The insertion point is the posterior calcaneus via the Achilles tendon. The gastrocnemius plays a role in plantar flexion of the foot and knee flexion. Along with several other leg muscles, the calf muscles play an important role in how an individual stands, walks, runs, and jumps, making them essential muscles for both daily living and performance-based activities.</string>
