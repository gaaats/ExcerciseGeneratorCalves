    <string name="text_activity_good">We know you want to get onto the best tricep exercises (that is why you are here right?), so well keep this short. Put simply, your triceps are the muscles located on the back of the upper arm, and are made up of three heads: the lateral, medial and long heads. If you want to hit all three heads then you are going to need a range of different exercises and plethora of different tricep workouts, which is where the next section of this article comes in. The triceps is an extensor muscle of the elbow joint and an antagonist of the biceps and brachialis muscles. \n\n It has been suggested that the long head fascicle is employed when sustained force generation is demanded, or when there is a need for a synergistic control of the shoulder and elbow or both.</string>
